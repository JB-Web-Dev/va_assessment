   (Google, ChatGPT, Claude, Stack Overflow, spreadsheets, etc.)

2. **What was the hardest part of this exercise?**

3. **How did you figure it out when you got stuck?**

4. **Is there anything you'd do differently if you did this again?**

5. **Any feedback on the exercise itself?**
   (Too hard? Too easy? Confusing instructions? We'd love to hear it.)

## Where to Put Your Reflection

# Task 2: Explore and Discover

Nice work on Task 1! Now let's dig a little deeper.

## What You'll Do

### Question A: Find the Hidden File
There's a hidden file somewhere in this repository. Your job is to find it and report what it says.

**Hint**: Not all files show up when you list a directory's contents. Some files are "hidden" by design. How might you reveal them?

### Question B: Count the Lines
How many lines are in `clients.csv`? You can include or exclude the header row — just tell us which you chose.

## Where to Put Your Answers

Create a file at `./answers/02_answer.txt` with both answers.

For example:
```
Question A - Hidden file contents: [what the hidden file said]
Question B - Line count: [your answer] (including/excluding header)
```

## Getting Help

Remember, you can use any resource:

- **Google**: "how to show hidden files in terminal" or "count lines in file terminal"
- **AI assistants**: ChatGPT, Claude, or others can walk you through it
- **The --help flag**: Commands often have built-in documentation
- **Hint file**: `./hints/02_hint.md` has more specific guidance if you're stuck

Don't worry about memorizing commands — real professionals look things up all the time.

## When You're Done

Move on to Task 3 at `./tasks/03_analyze.md` — this is the main challenge!

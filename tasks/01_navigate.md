# Task 1: Navigate and Explore

Welcome to your first task! This might feel unfamiliar if you've never used a terminal before — that's completely okay. The goal here is to get comfortable moving around and looking at files.

## What You'll Do

1. **Navigate to the data folder**
   - The `data` folder contains the files you'll work with in this exercise
   - You need to "change directory" into it

2. **Display the contents of `clients.csv`**
   - Once you're in the data folder, display what's in the `clients.csv` file
   - This file contains client information you'll analyze later

3. **Count the clients**
   - How many clients are listed in the file? (Don't count the header row)
   - Write your answer down

## Where to Put Your Answer

Create a file at `/answers/01_answer.txt` with your answer to question 3.

For example, your answer file might just say:
```
Number of clients: [your answer]
```

## Getting Help

If you're stuck, here are some options:

- **Google it**: Try searching "how to change directory in terminal" or "how to display file contents in terminal"
- **Ask an AI**: ChatGPT or Claude can explain terminal commands
- **Use --help**: Most commands have a `--help` flag that explains how they work (e.g., `ls --help`)
- **Check the hint**: There's a hint available at `/hints/01_hint.md` if you need it

Remember: using these resources isn't cheating — it's exactly what we're testing. Real work involves looking things up!

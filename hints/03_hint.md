# Hint for Task 3

## Breaking Down the Margin Calculation

The formula might look intimidating, but it's just three steps:

1. **Effective Rate** = Monthly Retainer ÷ Monthly Hours
   - Example: $3,000 ÷ 20 hours = $150/hour effective rate

2. **Profit per Hour** = Effective Rate - Hourly Cost
   - Example: $150 - $100 cost = $50 profit per hour

3. **Margin %** = (Profit per Hour ÷ Effective Rate) × 100
   - Example: ($50 ÷ $150) × 100 = 33.3% margin

## Finding Clients Without Recent Rate Increases

Look at the "Last Rate Increase" column. If today is January 2025, then:
- Anything before January 2023 = more than 2 years ago
- Check each client's date and compare

## Calculating Average Margin

1. Calculate the margin for each client
2. Add all the margins together
3. Divide by the number of clients (10)

## Using a Spreadsheet

It's totally fine to copy the CSV data into Google Sheets or Excel if that's easier for you! Here's how:

1. Open the CSV file and copy all the contents
2. Paste into a spreadsheet
3. Use formulas to calculate margins
4. This is a valid approach — use whatever tools help you get the job done

## AI Assistance

AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude are great for:
- Explaining the formula in different words
- Checking your math
- Helping you write spreadsheet formulas
- Answering "how do I...?" questions

Just describe what you're trying to do, and they can guide you through it.

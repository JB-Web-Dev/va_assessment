# Hint for Task 1

Here are some helpful terminal commands:

## Changing Directories
To move into a folder:
```
cd foldername
```

To go back up one level:
```
cd ..
```

## Listing Folder Contents
To see what's in the current folder:
```
ls
```

## Displaying File Contents
To show what's inside a file:
```
cat filename
```

## Example Workflow
If you wanted to go into a folder called "documents" and look at a file called "notes.txt":
```
cd documents
cat notes.txt
```

Remember: adapt these examples to the actual folder and file names in this exercise!

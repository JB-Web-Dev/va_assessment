# JB Web Virtual Assistant Assessment

Hi! Welcome to this exercise.

## Before You Start

**You're not expected to know terminal commands.** This exercise is about problem-solving and resourcefulness, not prior knowledge.

Feel free to use whatever helps you figure things out:
- Google searches
- AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- The `--help` flag on commands
- YouTube tutorials
- Stack Overflow
- Anything else!

Using these resources isn't cheating — it's exactly how real work gets done.

## What to Expect

This exercise has 4 tasks and should take about **45-60 minutes**:

1. **Navigate** — Get comfortable moving around in the terminal
2. **Explore** — Find files and count lines
3. **Analyze** — Work with data (the main challenge)
4. **Reflect** — Share your experience

The tasks get progressively more challenging, but they're all doable with some research and persistence.

## Getting Started

Open the first task file to begin:

```
/tasks/01_navigate.md
```

(You can click on it in the file explorer on the left, or open it from the terminal.)

## If You Get Stuck

Each task has a hint file available in the `/hints/` folder. There's no penalty for using hints — they're there to help!

- Task 1 hint: `/hints/01_hint.md`
- Task 2 hint: `/hints/02_hint.md`
- Task 3 hint: `/hints/03_hint.md`

## Where to Put Your Answers

Save your answers in the `/answers/` folder:
- Task 1: `/answers/01_answer.txt`
- Task 2: `/answers/02_answer.txt`
- Task 3: `/answers/03_answer.txt`
- Task 4: `/answers/04_reflection.txt`

## When You're Done

Run the finish script to generate your submission:

```
./finish.sh
```

This will compile all your answers into a summary you can copy and send.

Good luck! Remember, we're interested in how you approach problems, not whether you already know the answers.
